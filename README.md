# Core elements of a German psychiatric patient record in FHIR

Is it possible to identify and integrate core elements of a psychiatric patient record, and can they be fully coded in an internationally standardized way, stored in the central IT infrastructure of the Charit√© independently of the manufacturer and automatically contextualized for evaluation? 

The aim of standardization in FHIR is interoperable data processing of health information. This includes biological measurement data, but more frequently the collection of health information using questionnaires.

The data that is relevant for processing the research question is compiled here.
